# ASL-detection
This project implements a statistical-based system for recognizing American Sign Language gestures using feature extraction and machine learning algorithms. Unlike deep learning approaches that rely on neural networks, this system utilizes statistical methods for robust ASL detection.

Features
Real-time ASL Gesture Recognition: Detect and interpret signs from video input

Statistical Feature Extraction: Utilizes hand-crafted features for gesture representation

Multiple Classification Algorithms: Support for various statistical models

26 ASL Letters Recognition: Comprehensive alphabet support

Performance Metrics: Detailed evaluation of recognition accuracy

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

OpenCV 4.0+
